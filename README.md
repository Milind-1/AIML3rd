This project implements simple and multiple linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features.

## Contents
- `housing_price_prediction.ipynb`: Complete analysis notebook
- `Housing.csv`: Original dataset

## Key Findings
- Area is the strongest single predictor of price (R² = [value])
- Multiple regression with all features achieves R² = [value]
- Most important features: [list top features]
- Residual analysis shows [normality/homoscedasticity issues if any]

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook
